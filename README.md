# *bedrock*

A playbook of the architectural root of my security model. It defines the foundational layers, principles and controls that every system must satisfy before it can be considered trusted.

## *The Defense-in-Depth Model*

Security is executed sequentially from the absolute core hardware outward to my online alias. If a lower layer is compromised, the integrity of all layers above it is void.

```
[ Layer 5: Identity ] --- Persona
    [ Layer 4: Credentials ] --- Password Manager, TOTP
        [ Layer 3: Gateway ] --- Browser, Search Engine
            [ Layer 2: Network ] --- Router, Firewall, DNS
                [ Layer 1: Compute ] --- Operating System
                    [ Layer 0: Core ] --- Firmware/UEFI
```
