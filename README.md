### the undo button for pacman

**unpacman** is a tool for Arch Linux and Arch-based distributions that aims to provide a true "undo" for pacman operations.

## Features
- Full removal of packages installed via pacman;
- Tracking of changes for clean and reliable uninstalls;
- Simple, familiar and Arch-focused design.
