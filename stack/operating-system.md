#### Operating System

Purpose:

The operating system is the foundation of the security stack. Every other security control depends on the OS enforcing permissions, isolation, updates, and resource access.

### Requirements

An operating system should:

- Receive frequent security updates
- Support full-disk encryption
- Provide strong process isolation
- Have a transparent security model
- Minimize telemetry
- Allow user control
- Have a large security-conscious community

### Recommendations

#### Linux
(hm actually, linux is not an operating system, its a kernel.)

##### Arch Linux

Pros:
- Minimal by default
- User-controlled
- Fast security updates
- Extensive documentation

Cons:
- Requires maintenance
- User mistakes can reduce security

##### Fedora

Pros:
- Strong security defaults
- SELinux enabled by default
- Frequent updates

Cons:
- Less minimal than Arch

### Not Recommended

#### End-of-Life Systems

Operating systems that no longer receive security updates should not be used.

Examples:
- Windows 7
- Ubuntu releases past support
- Unmaintained Linux distributions

### My Baseline

Current Recommendation:
- Fedora/Debian for most users
- Arch Linux for advanced users
